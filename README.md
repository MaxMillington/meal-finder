# Mealfinder

MealFinder is an app made to connect food banks, soup kitchens, and homeless shelters with those in need. Around 65% of the homeless own cell phones. Additionally, a significant number of America's hungry are simply underpaid families living just outside of cities. Mealfinder provides a single unified map detailing the locations of any place giving out free meals, and also sends daily text messages to any registered number listing where to find a free meal that day.

MealFinder also automatically registers phone numbers via text, and automatically verifies that all registered numbers can receive SMS messages.
